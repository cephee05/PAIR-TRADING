**🚀 Crypto-Arbitrage Project Overview**

The **Crypto-Arbitrage** repository implements a complete framework for developing, testing, and deploying statistical arbitrage (“pair-trading”) strategies on financial markets. Its key components are:

* **📄 Theory & Documentation (`docs/`)**
  A concise write-up (`overview.md`) explaining the mathematical foundations of pair trading: correlation vs. cointegration tests, spread computation, z-scores, and variance formulas.

* **📊 Data Pipeline (`data/`)**

  * `raw/`: ingest raw OHLC price feeds (CSV or API dumps)
  * `processed/`: cleaned time-series with computed spreads, rolling stats, and normalized features

* **📓 Exploratory Notebooks (`notebooks/`)**
  Interactive analyses to:

  1. 🔍 Select optimal cointegrated pairs
  2. 📈 Backtest mean-reversion, momentum, and stochastic stress strategies
  3. 🔄 Perform walk-forward simulations and sensitivity studies

* **⚙️ Modular Strategy Code (`src/`)**

  * `data_prep.py` & `stats_tests.py`: reusable functions for loading data, computing spreads, and running stat tests
  * `strategies/`: self-contained modules (`mean_reversion.py`, `momentum_pair.py`, `stochastic_stress.py`)
  * `sizing.py`: volatility-parity position sizing logic based on ATR

* **🤖 Automated Backtests (`backtest/`)**
  Scripts (`run_backtest.py`, `monte_carlo.py`) to launch large-scale simulations—Monte Carlo resampling, walk-forward analysis—producing equity curves and PnL distributions.

* **🏆 Results & Benchmarks (`results/` & `benchmarks/`)**
  Stored backtest outputs (CSV, pickle) and summary dashboards/plots to compare performance, drawdowns, and parameter sensitivities.

* **✅ Quality & Maintenance**

  * **Unit Tests (`tests/`)**: Validate data prep and strategy logic
  * **Requirements (`requirements.txt`)**: Pin all dependencies for reproducibility
  * **License (`LICENSE`)**: MIT license for open-source sharing

Together, this structure delivers a robust, end-to-end toolkit for researching, validating, and refining crypto-pair arbitrage strategies—perfect for quants, developers, and trading analysts alike! 😊
