STRATEGIE 2

The difference between two momentum Indicators using the 6_day raw stochastic (using RSI or MACD would given similar results)

1 == sell the stronger when one stock is overbought at 90 and the momentum difference is greater than 70, or some other threshold. That argues the overbought stock will correct but does not say anything about the other leg of the pair.

EXIT == Exit when the overbought stock corrects to neutral or the momentum difference narrows to a neutral level.

2 == buy the weaker when the momentum difference is below -20 and sell when the difference is the opposite.

EXIT == Exit when the difference crosses zero
