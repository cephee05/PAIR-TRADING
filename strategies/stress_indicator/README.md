STRATEGIE 3

based on stochastic oscillator

stress indicator

D(t) = the difference between stchastic(1) and stchastic(2) at time t

stress(t)= (D(t) - min(Di))/((max(Di) - min(Di))

for i = t-n, t-1

BUY == buy (leg1) and sell (leg2) when stress(t) < 5. Exit when stress(t) >= 50

SELL == sell (leg1) and buy (leg2) when stress(t) >95 . Exit when stress(t) <= 50

!! The success of this technique depends on how strongly the market trends !! Momentum indicators show price fluctuation over the calculation period, but in a very quiet market, the range of that fluctuation will be small to trade. This can be fixed by loking at the average true range of the price range from the last momentum low and using a minimum volatility filter.

END.
