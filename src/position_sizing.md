POSITION SIZING

Volatility Parity Position Sizing calculate the ATR (generaly on 20 days) and divide the price of the same investment (ex 1000 usd) by the ATR

Example : A = 5$, B= 25$ and ATR(A) = 0.25$ "low relative volatility" and ATR(B) = 1$ "higher relative volatility"

position : P(A)= 1000/0.25 = 4000 units of A and P(B) = 1000/1 = 1000 units of B

so the position size is 4 times larger for A than for B
